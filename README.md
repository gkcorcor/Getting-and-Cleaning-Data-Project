# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This is the repository containing all material relevant to the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The objective is to read the wearable data extracted from Samsung Smartphone accelerometers of 30 subjects during 6 different activities.

Several disparate datasets are read in and concatenated to create a master dataset with a subset of variables that are given more-meaningful names.

The details of the data used can be found here:

run_analysis.R contains all the R code that transforms the data as described in the 5 step process.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data and transformations that were performed to clean the data.

tidydata.txt is the independent tidy data set the includes the averages of each variable for each activity and subject.
